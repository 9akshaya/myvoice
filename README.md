# myvoice 
created a voice assistant without using AI tools only using python libraries 
this voice assistant takes command from user in the form of voice command 
this voice assistant is named as 'ROBOT' this voice assistant plays songs from youtube,it says time,it answers to general questions like who is president of india..,and its a funny assistant that makes us laugh by tellings jokes 
the python libraries that i used to make this project are: 
speech-recognition library-this library is used for recognizing the commands from user which is given in the form of speech
pyttsx3 library-- this library is used for converting text to speech 
pywhatkit library-- i used this library to play songs on youtube 
datetime library--i used this library to tell us time 
and i used other two libraries pyjokes to listen jokes and another one is wikipedia library.
